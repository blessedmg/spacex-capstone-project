# spacex-capstone-project
Final project for IBM Data Science Capstone - Falcon 9 Landing Prediction

##  SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction â€“ IBM Data Science Capstone

This project is the final assignment in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The goal is to predict the success of Falcon 9 first-stage landings using historical SpaceX launch data.

###  Objective

To build a classification model that predicts whether the Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land, enabling cost-efficient mission planning.

###  Key Components

* **Data Collection**:

  * Web scraping from Wikipedia (BeautifulSoup)
  * REST API calls to SpaceX API
  * Supplementary datasets in CSV/JSON format

* **Data Wrangling & Exploration**:

  * Data cleaning, feature engineering, normalization
  * SQL-based analysis and visualizations (matplotlib, seaborn)

* **Interactive Dashboard**:

  * Built with Plotly Dash to explore mission outcomes by payload, orbit, and site

* **Machine Learning Models**:

  * Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, SVM
  * Best Model: Support Vector Machine (sigmoid kernel)
  * Accuracy: **83.33%** | F1 Score: **\~0.83**
